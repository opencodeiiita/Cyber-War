Both proxy servers and VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) can be useful tools for enhancing online privacy and security.

Purpose:
A proxy server acts as an intermediary between your device and the internet.
It can be used to hide your IP address, bypass internet filters and censorship, and access region-restricted content.
A VPN, on the other hand, encrypts all of your internet traffic and routes it through a secure server.
This helps protect your online activities from being monitored or intercepted by third parties,
such as your internet service provider or government agencies.

Security:
In general, VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) are considered to be more secure than proxy servers. This is because VPNs encrypt all
of your internet traffic and route it through a secure server, providing an additional layer of protection against online threats.
When you use a VPN, your internet traffic is encrypted and sent to a server operated by the VPN provider. From there, the traffic is
routed to its destination. This means that anyone trying to monitor or intercept your internet activity, such as your
internet service provider or government agencies, will only see encrypted data and will not be able to see the websites you visit
or the information you transmit.
Proxy servers, on the other hand, act as intermediaries between your device and the internet. They can be used to hide your IP address,
bypass internet filters and censorship, and access region-restricted content. However, they do not provide the same level of security as a VPN,
as they do not encrypt your internet traffic.
Overall, if there is a primarily concern with protecting our online privacy and security, a VPN will be the better option.
